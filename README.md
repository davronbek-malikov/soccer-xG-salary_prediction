## 👋 About This Repository and Author

This repository is part of a research project exploring how advanced metrics such as Expected Goals (xG), Actual Goals (aGg), and various performance indicators influence salary decisions in professional football.

The main goal is to develop predictive models that can explain and estimate weekly or annual player salaries based on performance metrics. This approach leverages machine learning techniques, traditional statistics, and visual storytelling.

The README also serves as a **resource guide**, listing learning materials, data sources, Python libraries, academic papers, blogs, and more — all curated from the amazing open source football analytics community.

This repository is always a **work in progress**. New resources, models, and insights are added regularly.

> If you think I’ve missed any valuable resource or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create a pull request or drop me a message!

If you find this repository useful, please ⭐ it — it motivates continued updates. Thank you!
